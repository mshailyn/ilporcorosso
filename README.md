# Il Porco Rosso Restaurant
This is a mockup of an earlier project I worked on designing a restaurant website.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS

This project wa sheavily focused on HTML and CSS as this was language I wanted to practice at the time. I used Javascript to make the menu interactive and use one space to display 5 different menus. There is also some other Javascript and SASS but most of this was utilized from templates.

## Lessons Learned:

Thisp orject allowed to me to start practicing a lot with using javacript to make my application more interactive and using HTML and CSS to bring this project to life.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
